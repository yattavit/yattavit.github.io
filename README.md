## Personal Projects

### Dog Rescue Management System [Local Full Stack Application: Python, Tkinter, MySQL Connector]
Developed a multi-window desktop application using Tkinter to streamline operations for a dog rescue shelter, including volunteer management, dog intake, and adoption processing.

Engineered a data pipeline to initialize and populate a MySQL database by parsing data from multiple .tsv files and executing schema creation scripts.

Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, connecting the GUI to the database backend to manage records for dogs, adopters, applications, and expenses.

Designed and coded complex business logic, such as a system for dynamically calculating adoption fees based on a dog's history and expenses logged in the database.

### Loan Defaulter Machine Learning Classification *<font size="3"> [Python, scikit-learn, Applied Machine Learning]  </font>*
[GitHub](https://yattavit.github.io/AI200_ML_Classification_Project_LendingClubLoanDefaultersPrediction/)

Business Case: Develop a Machine Learning model for the company to identify if the loan applicant is likely or unlikely to default on the loan, thereby assisting in the company's portfolio & risk assessment capabilities

Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA], feature-engineering & model testing was conducted using **Python** within the **JupyterNotebook** environment. Various feature engineering techniques & models were experimented & the best AUC scoring model was then selected & applied to form the final model.

The final model, along with the feature-engineered dataframe, acheived a **~90% predictive AUC score** after cross-validation via the Kaggle platform, thus demonstrating a strong ablity to discriminate between loan applicants whom are likely or unlikely to default on loans.

### Shopee Code League: Logistics *<font size="3"> [Python]  </font>*
[GitHub](https://yattavit.github.io/Shopee_Code_League_Logistics/)

Background: Amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, the surge in online orders on Shopee has heightened the importance of on-time delivery, a critical factor in e-commerce success. To meet this demand, Shopee has partnered with top-performing logistics providers across the region, enforcing SLAs and penalties to ensure timely deliveries. This rigorous monitoring and accountability process reinforces Shopee's commitment to delivering goods punctually, enhancing user confidence.

Task: Identify all the orders that are considered late depending on the Service Level Agreements (SLA) with Shopee's Logistics Provider.

### Hotel Revenue Analysis *<font size="3"> [PowerBI, PowerQuery M, T-SQL, SQL Server Management Studio, Excel, PowerPoint]    </font>*
[GitHub](https://yattavit.github.io/Hotel-Revenue-Analysis-Project/)

Business Case: A business manager of a chain of hotel would like to request help from the data analytics team to develop a dashboard to analyze & visualize hotel booking data

 - The business manager is interested if there’s any patterns/ seasonality with respect to:  
   1) Guests  
   2) Revenue  

Requirement: Build a Dashboard using **PowerBI** to provide at-a-glance information about features that are relevant to revenue

Data from raw .csv file was ingested into **SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS]**, from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis & visualization. Additional data processing was done in PowerBI with **PowerQuery M** for visualization purposes.

Guests, revenue seasonality, recommendation for staffing arrangement, and dataset limitations were explained with the help of additional visualizations done in PowerBI in the accompanying **Powerpoint slides**.
